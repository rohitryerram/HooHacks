## Inspiration
With the rise of online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team was inspired to develop an interactive platform for students and teachers that mimics the experience of being in an in person classroom.

## What it does
The Club Scholars platform allows students to virtually "move" around their custom designed classroom to access different components such as the lecture, recess rooms, collaborative stations, and teacher meetings, providing a realistic classroom experience. Teachers can customize their classrooms, assign homework, and present course content.

## How we built it
- HTML
- CSS
- JavsScript
- Phaser.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Some technical challenges we ran into include loading sprites and images, implementing player movement, and transitioning between different rooms. To solve these issues, we took the initiative to read Phaser.js documentation, and publicly available code that solved similar issues.

## Our Accomplishments
Since it was our first time working with the Phaser.js software, we are proud to have learned the new skills that allowed us to successfully produce moving components on a local browser. We are also proud to have worked with a team to develop basic ideas into an actual product, and an effective pitch.

## What's next for Club Scholars
We hope to implement a user friendly UI with functioning video and audio components, a dynamic grading scheme for teachers, and develop more interactive rooms for students to use like libraries and other staff offices.
